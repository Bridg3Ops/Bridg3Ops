# Hello, I'm Abraham

## About Me

Cybersecurity Analyst with a strong focus on SOC operations, threat detection, and incident response. I enjoy working with tools like Microsoft Sentinel & Splunk to investigate alerts and create detection logic.

Currently exploring ethical hacking and threat hunting techniques to understand adversary behaviour and improve blue-team defences through offence-informed strategies.
