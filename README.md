# Hello, I'm Abraham

## About Me

I am passionate about cybersecurity, focusing on SOC operations, threat detection, and incident response. I enjoy working with SIEM platforms like Microsoft Sentinel, analyzing security incidents, and developing detection rules. I am also exploring threat hunting, IOC documentation, and security operations to enhance detection and response capabilities.
